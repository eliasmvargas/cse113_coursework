PURPOSE:
This project is an attempt to recreate Conway's game of life simulation in the C programming language.
This is my first time using command line arguments within my program.

The bulk of this code works with a manually allocated 2d array, which caused for some difficult challenges.

TODO:
It is considered bad practice to define global variables. I will work on implementing a more streamlined solution.
I have yet to implement the feature to import .lif files in both the 1.05 and 1.06 formats.

BUGS: 
This program contains significant memory leaks. I am currently working on implementing a better system here to
manage memory.

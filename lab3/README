PURPOSE:
This program is designed to showcase a number of array algorithms and their outputs. 

Pair programming helped quite a bit actually, though as an introvert of course I enjoyed the individual part more.

BUGS:
None AFAIK

Improvements:
Perhaps more functions..

Through this lab I learned much more about how arrays work, and how to manipulate values inside of them. Very useful for pretty much all things data.




Pseudo code:

// counts number of elements in the array less than x

for i = 1 to N
    if A[i] < x
        count = count + 1

// counts number of elements in the array less than or equal to x

for i = 1 to N 
    if A[1] <= x
        count = count + 1

// counts number of elements in the array greater than or equal to x

for i = 1 to N 
    if A[1] >= x
        count = count + 1

// counts number of elements in the array greater than x

for i = 1 to N 
    if A[1] > x
        count = count + 1

// swaps array elements

for i = 1 to N 
    temp = A[i]
    A[i] = A[array size - 1 - index]
    A[array size - 1 - index] = temp

// even term counter

for i = 1 to N 
    if A[i] mod 2 = 0
        count = count + 1

// odd term counter

for i = 1 to N 
    if A[i] mod 2 = 1
        count = count + 1

PURPOSE:
Lab8.c works with linked lists to do a few different processes with them.
collatz.c tests the collatz conjecture and calculates the cycle length given some input of n.

CONCLUSION:
I learned a lot more about linked lists and became significantly more comfortable with them.
The pair programming actually helped quite a bit this time.
I did not work with a buddy on this lab.
I encountered a few technical problems on lab8.c, which were fixed by just practicing and understanding how linked lists work.
I think lab8.c could probably be a bit more streamlined.

NOTICE!!!
Valgrind does not work on my machine, so I output the terminal output in a script called l8-valgrind.script using the mac m1 leaks command which doesn't have
a redirect output function as far as I know :(

PURPOSE:
This lab is designed to experiment with various algorithms for linked lists.
collatz.c tests the collatz conjecture and calculates the cycle length given some input of n.

CONCLUSION:
I learned a lot more about linked lists and became significantly more comfortable with them.
I encountered a few technical problems on lab8.c, which were fixed by just practicing and understanding how linked lists work.
I think lab8.c could probably be a bit more streamlined.

NOTICE!!!
Valgrind does not work on my machine. I saved the terminal output in a script called l8-valgrind.script 
using the mac m1 leaks command which doesn't have a redirect output function as far as I know. I will be looking into
how to do just that.

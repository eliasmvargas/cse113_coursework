An archive of all of my coursework from the Fall 2023 semester in CSE113: introduction to programming in C.
Excerpt from course syllabus: 

"This course is designed to introduce problem solving and
programming in C to Computer Science majors and those interested in applications of the
language that involve dynamic structures and memory management. Topics include
algorithm development; top-down design; modular programming; debugging; testing;
control structures including selection, iteration and recursion; number systems; data
representation; data types including arrays, strings, pointers and dynamic structures
involving memory management. Concepts implemented through extensive programming
using good programming style."

PURPOSE:
This lab explores the properties of switch statements and nested functions. It was also a stepping stone to compiling multi-file
programs.

The program pp8.c was quite challenging with implementing inequalities that were logically sound. I also ran into problems with function prototyping at first in the header file for the geometry calculator file.

BUGS:
When the user inputs more than 1 character in rock-spock.c, the functions aren't able to handle the exception well.

IMPROVEMENTS/TODO:
Fix rock-spock input to handle inputs of more than 1 character.

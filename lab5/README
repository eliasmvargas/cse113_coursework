PURPOSE:
This program utilizes structures and performs various functions on the variables within those structures. 
It then prints out the structure index resulting from said functions.

CONCLUSIONL
I learned a very crucial skill: structs and how to use them. During lab3 I was thinking to myself the entire time:
"There has to be a better way to do this." And this is just that!

I encountered several problems, mostly pertaining to calling and updating parts of certain structs. 
This was tedious, but I think wrestling with it really helped me.

BUGS:
None AFAIK

TODO/IMPROVEMENTS:
I can't think of any improvements for this very specific task. 
Though I think maybe more algorithms could be really neat!

Purpose:
This program utilizes structures and performs various functions on the variables within those structures. 
It then prints out the structure index resulting from said functions.

Conclusion:
I learned a very crucial skill: structs and how to use them. During lab3 I was thinking to myself the entire time "There has to be a better way to do this." And this is just that!

The pair programming prelab really helped me brush up on my array algorithms before jumping into the more difficult task of this lab.

I encountered several problems, mostly pertaining to calling and updating parts of certain structs. This was tedious, but I think wrestling with it really helped me.

There are no bugs as far as I am aware.

I can't think of any improvements for this very specific task. Though I think maybe more algorithms could be really neat!

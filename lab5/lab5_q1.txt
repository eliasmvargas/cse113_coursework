The use case for a structure is when you are dealing with several different variables and need to store them in one convenient package. 
Contrarily, an array is most useful when you have a single variable with several entries that you need to conveniently keep track of.
You can get use both simultaneously and have an array of structs when you have several variables that are related and need to be grouped, 
with several entries on each of those variables.

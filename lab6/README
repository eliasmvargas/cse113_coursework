PURPOSE:
This program is designed to track data from a simulated zombie apocalpse.

I mostly learned the logistics of using a struct and implementing it in more advanced ways. 
Practicing the combination of using various techniques in this has been very helpful.
I mostly encountered problems with data validation and also getting the while loops to work properly. 

BUGS:
The main bug occurs when inputting several characters into the scanfs, it causes an infinite print loop which is really annoying.

TODO/IMPROVEMENTS:
I think it would be neat to store the data in another file so that it is saved even after closing the program.

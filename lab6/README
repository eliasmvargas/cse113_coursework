This program is designed to track data from a simulated zombie apocalpse.

I mostly learned the logistics of using a struct and implementing it in more advanced ways. Also just practicing the combination of using various techniques in this has been very helpful.
The pair programming was useful I'd say. Makefiles can be a bit tricky and I'm still a little confused on them.
I mostly encountered problems with data validation and also getting the while loops to work properly. 

Bugs: The main bug occurs when inputting several characters into the scanfs, it causes an infinite print loop which is really annoying and I'm not sure how to fix.
Future fix: I think it would be neat to store the data in another file so that it is saved even after closing the program.

NOTICE TO GRADER!!:

[PROFESSOR] specifically said for this lab that we don't actually need to malloc anything
because we already have an allocated size for the array.
So no need for two different script files, or for freeing in general.

da.out file is in a script file rather than redirection, I could not find information on how to redirect with leaks for mac m1.

PURPOSE:
This lab experiments with pointers and strings, and implementing algorithms on said strings. In C, strings are different
than in languages where there is a defined "str" type. They are implemented by using an array of characters, either with
bracket notation or with pointers.

CONCLUSION:
This lab helped me get a much better grasp on pointers.
